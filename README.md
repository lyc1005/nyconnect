The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the existential importance of internet connectivity in our modern daily lives. However, internet is not magic. It does not exist in a vacuum. As consumers, we are connected to the internet by Internet Service Providers such as Verizon, and Charter, just to name a few. Like any other economic activity, it is regulated by the city government. However, just because its ubiquity is not synonymous with universality. More than 1.5 million New Yorkers, or approximately 18%, do not have any high-speed internet connection.  

Hence, the question that needs to be answered is whether there is an optimal number of Internet Service Providers for the New York City market that can improve internet accessibility in terms of coverage area, household adoption rates, and affordability for all New Yorkers. A corollary of that is the question of how affordability can be measured and determined. 

To answer these questions, the team looked into service provision data from the Federal Communications Commission, demographic surveys from the Census Bureau, geographic boundaries from the New York City government, pricing data scraped by DoITT, and consumer tweets. The data processing and analytical methods include:
* Geoprocessing in QGIS and Python
* Spatial Autocorrelation
* Spatial Regression
* KMeans Clustering
* Bayesian Network
* Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis
