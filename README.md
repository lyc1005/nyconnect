#### Overview

The Covid-19 pandemic has revealed the existential importance of internet connectivity in our modern daily lives. However, internet is not magic. It does not exist in a vacuum. As consumers, we are connected to the internet by Internet Service Providers such as Verizon, and Charter, just to name a few. Like any other economic activity, it is regulated by the city government. However, just because its ubiquity is not synonymous with universality. More than 1.5 million New Yorkers, or approximately 18%, do not have any high-speed internet connection.  

Hence, there are a few questions to be answered:  
* Is there an optimal number of Internet Service Providers for the New York City urban broadband market in achieving the goal of universal broadband access?
* What can the government do to achieve universal broadband access?  
* How can broadband affordability be measured and determined?

To answer these questions, the team looked into service provision data from the Federal Communications Commission, demographic surveys from the Census Bureau, geographic boundaries from the New York City government, pricing data scraped by DoITT, and consumer tweets. The data processing and analytical methods include:
* Geoprocessing in QGIS and Python
* Spatial Autocorrelation
* Spatial Regression
* KMeans Clustering
* Bayesian Network
* Text Mining and Sentiment Analysis
  
Fundamentally, there is a price-floor to how low broadband plans can cost in the free market given how much capital investment is needed in the first place. Increased competition can only do so much to bring the costs down. Instead, the results of this project point towards a policy framework that focuses on subsidizing access for the most needy. Income is the most significant variable in determining a household's decision to subscribe to broadband access, not the number of providers.
